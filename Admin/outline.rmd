## Scope

The course will cover the basics of linear and (mostly) generalized linear models; I will assume familiarity with ANOVA and linear regression. While the theoretical framework will be presented, the emphasis will be on solving practical problems. We will go into detail on preparing data for analysis; deciding on and implementing an appropriate models; diagnosing model fit; and interpreting results. Some important statistical topics that I feel are insufficiently covered elsewhere in the curriculum (snooping/garden of forking paths, ethics, data wrangling) will be covered in passing.

## Assignments and assessment

The assignments for the course will consist of biweekly problem sets (a mixture of computational (R-based) and analytical work) (25%), midterm exam (take-home: 25%), a project/extended data analysis (10%) and a take-home final exam (35%). Class participation (see below) will count for 5%.

Grades will be posted on Avenue.

The due dates for assignments are on the [course schedule](https://bbolker.github.io/stat4c03/admin/schedule.html). Assignments are to be handed in before 11:59 PM on the day they are due.  Your submission must be in the form of a plain-text file (`.R`, `.Rnw`, or `.Rmd`) along with graphs stored as PDFs and any data files that are necessary to make it run. It must be reproducible on my and the TA's computer.
- There will be a 10% per day late penalty.
- An example of a homework assignment in acceptable format is given under the [HomeworkExample](https://github.com/bbolker/stat4c03/tree/master/HomeworkExample) directory on the course repository.

### Participation marks

Although you may have experienced otherwise in other courses, these marks will not be arbitrary/subjective.
Occasionally throughout the semester, you will be asked to write either the instructor or your TA an email (a few sentences to a paragraph) on a particular topic (**subject `4/6C03 participation`**).  The purpose of these emails is for us to be able to assess your depth of understanding of non-technical material.  This will allow us to give you feedback and will hopefully make the preparation of your final report at the end of the term less stressful.  If you do not come to lecture you will not hear about these participatory emails.  If you do not send these emails you will receive a low participation mark. You can also enhance your participation mark by engaging with in-class exercises and coming to office hours.

You can gain your first participation mark by sending an e-mail to the instructor or the TA whose *subject line* is "stats 4/6C03: `<your_macid>` read the outline", where `<your_macid>` is your MacID (not your student number!)

## Legal stuff

### Policies

1.  **Policy on missed work or lectures:** You should be aware of the
    [Policy For Absence from School Due to Illness or Compassionate Reasons](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=559#Requests_for_Relief_for_Missed_Academic_Term_Work)
    It is important to know your rights and your responsibilities. If
    you must miss a presentation or cannot submit assigned work on
    time for a valid reason (e.g., medical reasons, etc.) you may be
    able to obtain an excused absence by taking appropriate
    documentation (e.g.  note from physician) to the Faculty/Program
    office and then discussing this with your instructor. If the
    Faculty/Program gives its approval, the final examination will
    then be given the appropriate extra weighting. Otherwise, a grade
    of zero will be entered for the missed work.

    If you must miss a lecture or lab, it is your responsibility to find out
    what was covered. The best way to do this is to borrow a classmate's
    notes, read them over, and then ask your instructor if there is
    something that you do not understand.

2.  Students' grades will be returned on Avenue.

### Accommodations

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. Student Accessibility Services can be contacted by phone 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or e-mail `sas@mcmaster.ca`. For further information, consult McMaster University’s [Policy for Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities](http://www.mcmaster.ca/policy/Students-AcademicStudies/AcademicAccommodation-StudentsWithDisabilities.pdf).

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar “Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work”.

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious,
indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set
out in the RISO policy. Students requiring a RISO accommodation should
submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10
working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need
for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their
examinations.  Students should also contact their instructors as soon
as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments,
and tests.

### Grading scheme

I reserve the right to change the weightings in the grading scheme. If changes are made, your grade will be calculated using the original weightings and the new weightings, and you will be given the higher of the two grades. At the end of the course the grades may be adjusted but this can only increase your grade and will be done uniformly. I will use the following grade chart to convert between letter grades, grade points and percentages:

A+     A     A-     B+    B 	B- 	  C+    C 	  C-    D+ 	  D     D-    F
---    ---   ---    ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---
12     11 	 10 	9 	  8 	7 	  6     5     4 	3 	  2 	1 	  0
90-100 85-89 80-84  77-79 73-76 70-72 67-69 63-66 60-62 57-59 53-56 50-52 0-49

(from p. 29 of the current Undergraduate calendar)

### Dates subject to change

The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email. It is the responsibility of the student to check their McMaster email and course websites weekly during the term and to note any changes.

### Missing tests or work

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar “Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work” (see [here](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/con
tent.php?catoid=13&navoid=2208#Requests_for_Relief_for_Missed_Academic_Term_Work)). Please note these regulations have changed beginning Fall 2015, in particular:

- The time frame within which the MSAF is valid has been reduced from 5 days to 3 days.
- The upper limit for which an MSAF can be submitted has been reduced from 'less than 30%' to 'less than 25%' of the course weight.

In most cases, missed work or tests will be addressed by reweighting the remaining work or tests. If you must miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to find out what was covered. The best way to do this is to borrow a classmate's notes, read them over, and then ask your instructor if there is something that you do not understand.

### Late work

All assignments are due on Avenue to Learn prior to class, unless otherwise stated. I reserve the right to penalize late work by 10% per day.

### Online component

We will be using the learning software Avenue to Learn. Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of this course, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts,
and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in this course will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.

### Academic Integrity

The expectations for this class are fairly simple: however, if you have any questions or concerns **please ask me**. See the McMaster Office of Academic Integrity’s web page for general information.

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behavior in all aspects of the learning process.  Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university.

It is **your responsibility** to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the *Academic Integrity Policy*, located at http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity. The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

- Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not your own or for which other credit has been obtained.
- Improper collaboration in group work.
- Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.

Some common academic dishonesty issues:

- *Plagiarism*: For example, the submission of work that is not one's own or for which other credit has been obtained.
- *Improper collaboration*: In this course, you are encouraged to discuss the assigned problems with other students in your class. You may *discuss* the solutions to problem sets, but **you must write up your solutions yourself without copying phrasing from other students’ work. If you work with others, you must clearly indicate on your write-up who you worked with.**  When work is not explicitly assigned as a group project you must write the solutions in your own words without referring to any other students' work. The copying or even paraphrasing of anyone's solutions will be considered academic dishonesty. For group projects, you will be asked to report your own assessment of how you contributed to the group's work.
- *Copying or using unauthorized aids in examinations*: In this course you are not allowed to talk to or communicate in any way (e.g. pass notes) with anyone but the instructor or the invigilators during an examination. In the case of a take-home exam, I will clearly indicate at the time what resources you may or may not use. You are on your honor to observe any specified time limits and to refrain from communicating with anyone other than the instructor/TA about the contents of the exam.
